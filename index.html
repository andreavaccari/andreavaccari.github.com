    Andrea is also a pretty good water polo player and loves to ski in the Alps during Christmas. He tries to travel as much as he can, and
    always throws away a shirt whenever he buys a new one to make sure that all his stuff can fit in a couple of suitcases.

    <h1>Glancee</h1> is a location-based mobile app that helps you discover the hidden connections you share with the people around you.
    Glancee highlights people that have friends in common, that went to the same school you attended, that work in your same company, or
    that share interests similar to yours.
  </div>
  <div class="grid_6">
    You can use Glancee to explore the profiles of people nearby, or you can keep it in your pocket and be notified if someone interesting
    is nearby. When you notice someone, text, call, and meet up for coffee. Create new, meaningful connections with people important to you.

    <h1>Obama | One People</h1> is a celebration of the President's election. With the MIT Senseable City Lab we analyzed the activity of
    the mobile phone network to characterize the movements and emotional reaction of the crowd that gathered in Washington, D.C. on January
    20, 2009.
  </div>
  <div class="grid_6">
    The results of our data analyses are presented in two visualizations that answer the questions: Who was in Washington, D.C. during
    Obama's Inauguration Day? When did they arrive, where did they go, and how long did they stay?

    <h1>Los Ojos del Mundo</h1> is a study of contemporary tourism in the region of the Iberian Peninsula. It is based on the analysis of
    the geotagged photos that were taken by visitors in the area, and uploaded to Flickr, which allowed to uncover the evolution of the
    presence and flows of tourists.
  </div>
  <div class="grid_6">
    The analysis and mapping of this data was useful at multiple levels. It allowed to quantify the popularity of leisure cities and their
    points of interests, as well as characterize the type of activities and trails of different nationalities.

    The project is the first example of reconfigurable architecture that allows spaces to expand and shrink based on necessity and use.
    Behind the scences, a real-time control system uses sensors to detect the presence of people and open passages, or to control the

    <h1>New York Talk Exchange</h1> illustrates the global flow of information by visualizing the volumes of long distance phone calls and
    Internet data exchanged between New York and other cities around the world. The project was exhibited for four months at the Museum of
    Modern Art in New York for the Design and Elastic Mind exhibition.

  <div class="grid_6">
    NYTE involved the analysis of large data sets of telecommunication logs at the scale of the local exchange. Our results revealed the
    relationships that New Yorkers entertain with the rest of the world, and showed how behavioral data can be used to better profile
    multiethnic neighborhoods.

    <h1>WikiCity Rome</h1> is a real-time interactive map that was installed in Rome in occasion of the Notte Bianca to provide city
    dwellers with actionable insights about the people and public services around them. It was built to illustrate the idea of the city as a
    real-time control system.
  </div>
  <div class="grid_6">
    The map showed the estimated distribution of people in the area (through cellphone activity analysis), the position of busses and cabs,
    and real-time updates by the journalists of the major Italian newspaper which were broadcasted live from the location of the events.
