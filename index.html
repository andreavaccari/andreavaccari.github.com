            Andrea is also a pretty good water polo player and loves to ski in the Alps during Christmas. He tries to
            travel as much as he can, and always throws away a shirt whenever he buys a new one to make sure that his
            stuff can fit in a couple of suitcases.

            with the people around you. Glancee highlights people that have friends in common, that went to the same

            You can use Glancee to explore the profiles of people nearby, or you can keep it in your pocket and be

            Create new, meaningful connections with people important to you.

            <h1>Obama | One People</h1> is a celebration of the President's election. With the MIT Senseable City Lab
            we analyzed the activity of the mobile phone network to characterize the movements and emotional reaction
            of the crowd that gathered in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 2009.

            The results of our data analyses are presented in two visualizations that answer the questions: Who was in
            Washington, D.C. during Obama's Inauguration Day? When did they arrive, where did they go, and how long did
            they stay?

            <h1>Los Ojos del Mundo</h1> is a study of contemporary tourism in the region of the Iberian Peninsula. It
            is based on the analysis of the geotagged photos that were taken by visitors in the area, and uploaded to
            Flickr, which allowed to uncover the evolution of the presence and flows of tourists.
        </div>
        <div class="columned-50">
            The analysis and mapping of this data was useful at multiple levels. It allowed to quantify the popularity
            of leisure cities and their points of interests, as well as characterize the type of activities and trails
            of different nationalities.

            The project is the first example of reconfigurable architecture that allows spaces to expand and shrink
            based on necessity and use. Behind the scences, a real-time control system uses sensors to detect the
            presence of people and open passages, or to control the ceiling's height to avoid splashing.

            <h1>New York Talk Exchange</h1> illustrates the global flow of information by visualizing the volumes of
            long distance phone calls and Internet data exchanged between New York and other cities around the world.
            The project was exhibited for four months at the Museum of Modern Art in New York for the Design and

            NYTE involved the analysis of large data sets of telecommunication logs at the scale of the local exchange.
            Our results revealed the relationships that New Yorkers entertain with the rest of the world, and showed
            how behavioral data can be used to better profile multiethnic neighborhoods.

            The map showed the estimated distribution of people in the area (through cellphone activity analysis), the

            were broadcasted live from the location of the events.
