    Andrea is also a pretty good water polo player and loves to ski in the Alps during Christmas. He travels as much as he can, and always
    throws away a shirt whenever he buys a new one to make sure that all his stuff can fit in two suitcases.

    <h1><a href="http://senseable.mit.edu/obama">Obama | One People</a></h1> is a celebration of the President's election. With the MIT
    Senseable City Lab we analyzed the activity of the mobile phone network to characterize the movements and emotional reaction of the
    crowd that gathered in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 2009.
  </div>
  <div class="grid_6">
    The results of our data analyses are presented in two visualizations that answer the questions: Who was in Washington, D.C. during
    Obama's Inauguration Day? When did they arrive, where did they go, and how long did they stay?

    <h1><a href="http://senseable.mit.edu/worldseyes">The World's Eyes</a></h1> is a study of contemporary tourism in the region of the
    Iberian Peninsula. It is based on the analysis of the geotagged photos that were taken by visitors in the area, and uploaded to Flickr,
    which allowed to uncover the evolution of the presence and flows of tourists.
  </div>
  <div class="grid_6">
    The analysis and mapping of this data was useful at multiple levels. It allowed to quantify the popularity of leisure cities and their
    points of interests, as well as characterize the type of activities and trails of different nationalities.

    The project is the first example of reconfigurable architecture that allows spaces to expand and shrink based on necessity and use.

    <h1><a href="http://senseable.mit.edu/nyte">New York Talk Exchange</a></h1> illustrates the global flow of information by visualizing
    the volumes of long distance phone calls and Internet data exchanged between New York and other cities around the world. The project was
    exhibited for four months at the Museum of Modern Art in New York for the Design and Elastic Mind exhibition.
  </div>
  <div class="grid_6">
    NYTE involved the analysis of large data sets of telecommunication logs at the scale of the local exchange. Our results revealed the
    relationships that New Yorkers entertain with the rest of the world, and showed how behavioral data can be used to better profile
    multiethnic neighborhoods.

    occasion of the Notte Bianca to provide city dwellers with actionable insights about the people and public services around them. It was
    built to illustrate the idea of the city as a real-time control system.
  </div>
  <div class="grid_6">
    The map showed the estimated distribution of people in the area (through cellphone activity analysis), the position of busses and cabs,
    and real-time updates by the journalists of the major Italian newspaper which were broadcasted live from the location of the events.
